## Description
This is a small OpenGL 1.0 program that displays a 100x100 field of points that move up and down relative to a sinusoidal curve, resulting in a wave-like motion going from corner to corner.

## How to run the program
The command I used to compile this program is as follows:
> (will add command shortly)

Then, to run the program, simply type:
> ./PointWave

Please note that in order to compile this program, you need the libraries shown in the compilation command.

## Controls
There are a few keyboard controls that you can use in this program:
* Up-Arrow: Move the camera up
* Down-Arrow: Move the camera down
* Right-Arrow: Increase the speed of the wave movements
* Left-Arrow: Decrease the speed of the wave movements
* Escape: Close the program
